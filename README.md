Tools For Software Test Engineers
---------------------------------
As a software tester / Software QA Engineer / Product Acceptance Engineer, life is made simple by contemporary browsers like Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Google Chrome. You may utilize a variety of extensions while testing software. Tools enable us to test more quickly and easily.

We testers adore software testing tools because they make our testing lives easier. That is what it does for me, which is why I adore it.


Here is a selection of the best add-ons for testers to simplify your life.

Web UI Testing
===============

Page Ruler Redux:
-----------------
Page Ruler Redux is a no-frills tool that accomplishes what it promises to do. The height, breadth, and padding on each side of an element can be easily measured with this extension during testing by simply positioning it over the element and dragging it to extend a ruler in the correct direction. The PRR Chrome extension is invaluable for Web UI testing since it allows you to record issues that would otherwise go unnoticed, increasing the likelihood that you will ship a bug-free web app. 

WhatFont:
---------
You should also check the font family and font size used for a given portion of any website to ensure they are appropriate for the content. To locate the font information when testing, you may right-click, go to the elements, or examine the CSS. Or you may use a tool like WhatFont.WhatFont is a straightforward add-on that does exactly what it claims to do: locate fonts on any website. Locate the WhatFont button in the Browser menu bar. If you hover over a font on a website, you'll get a pop-up identifying the typeface.WhatFont also tells you which service is being utilized to supply the web fonts, in case you were wondering.

ColorZilla:
-----------
This extension, called ColorZilla, is a colour picker that enables you to identify any colour on the web without leaving your browser. Whether you need to check if the colour scheme of a website is compliant with design guidelines, ColorZilla is a great tool to utilize.

PerfectPixel:
-------------
This add-on is for you if you, like me, have high standards for the application under test and want to ensure it performs strictly as intended. You may use PerfectPixel to check whether or not your app's visuals are an exact match with the design. You can make a pixel-by-pixel comparison by placing a semi-transparent image overlay over the top of your web page.

Spell Checker:
--------------
Incorrect Spelling Detector This Chrome addon performs precisely what it claims to do. It scans a whole webpage and flags any misspelt words, then offers possible fixes. It's a straightforward Chrome add-on for verifying copied content during web testing, and it works in 12 different tongues. It's possible to edit the dictionary and add your own terms.

Grammarly:
----------
Whether you're writing an email, a remark, or a blog post, Grammarly can help you avoid embarrassing typos and grammatical errors. Grammarly is a web-based spellchecker and grammar checker that works in real-time to flag and correct your mistakes as you type. A free Chrom plugin, Grammarly integrates the power of Grammarly's grammar checker directly into your browser.

Automation Testing
=================
Web Developer:
--------------
The Web Developer Chrom Extension offers a wide variety of web developer tools in the form of a toolbar and is the official adaptation of the add-on with the same name as Firefox. It is one of the best Chrom extensions for testing, even if it does not support all of the functionality of its Firefox cousin. On every online page, you may fill out forms, manage cookies, manipulate the browser's cache, examine and highlight web components, title attributes, anchor data, and more, saving much time when testing.

Firebug Lite:
-------------
Another extension for software testing is Firebug Lite, which complements  Developer Tools' features rather than replacing them. It provides a detailed depiction of the Box Model shading, DOM components, and HTML elements. The ability to quickly analyze HTML components using Firebug Lite is quite helpful when automating your apps.

Test Evidence
=============
Awesome Screenshot:
-------------------
The most well-known screen capture program among software testers is called Awesome Screenshot. You may take a snapshot of the entire screen, a selected area, or any viewable material on a website while simultaneously annotating it with text, highlights, and other test evidence. It is simple to share the screenshot with others as test evidence after you are satisfied with it. You may save it as a PDF or a picture on your computer. Or you can upload it to Google Drive or Dropbox or temporarily host it with Awesome Screenshot. Additionally, Awesome Screenshot can be linked to other applications like Slack, Trello, Asana, Github, and Jira.

Lightshot:
----------
A simple and helpful screen capture program called Lightshot enables you to record screenshots for use as test evidence and customize them by adding annotations. It is lightweight and has a straightforward UI. The screenshots can be saved locally on your computer or online (which you can share as a link with others).

Website Cookie Testing
=======================
Edit This Cookie:
-----------------
This extension can save you a ton of time if you're testing A/B versions of a web application or want to see if a specific feature is accessible to a specific group of people. You can manage your browser cookies like a pro with the slick, well-organized interface that Edit This Cookie offers. It displays set cookies and their values, and you may add, remove, search for, protect, or block cookies and modify any of the existing set values. You may avoid the inconvenience of navigating to the Chrome settings page to look for cookies for a certain website by using this extension.
Cookie Editor: Another extension you may use to alter cookies while testing is Cookie Editor. You can add, remove, amend, protect, block, and search cookies, just as it says on the tin. You may export cookies in JSON format with this tool as well.

Cache Killer:
-------------
For Chrom testers, Cache Killer is a helpful extension that makes it simple to turn off caching. Unlike Clear Cache, it clears the browser cache when activated before loading a page, ensuring that you always receive the most recent code from the server. You may quickly and easily turn off this add-on if you're testing the caching functionality of your application.

Screen Sizes Testing
===================
Window Resizer:
---------------
Another valuable add-on for testing web apps is Window Resizer. It emulates multiple screen resolutions for Chrome, just like Firesizer does for Firefox, so you can test how the layout of websites works on various screen sizes. You may create your own custom resolution size or choose from predefined screen resolutions (and save them). There are a few characteristics that Resolution Test lacks and Window Resizer has: You may customize the global key shortcuts in Window Resizer, export your settings and reload them into a new machine.

LambdaTest:
----------
Testing across desktop and mobile browsers. A variety of Windows and Mac operating systems, as well as the earliest and most recent browsers, are available for your selection.

Exploratory Testing
===================
Bug Magnet:
-----------
During exploratory testing, this addon Bug Magnet is a big-time saver. To get a context menu containing pre-defined values for emails, names, phone numbers, postcodes, etc., right-click on any field in the web application. The field you are in on the website is filled in when you select the value you require. The next time you design exploratory testing, Bug Magnet will create all test values for field value testing for you.

Web Developer Form Filler:
---------------------------
Filling out form fields is simple using the plugin Web Developer Form Filler, which also works well for exploratory testing. Hotkeys may be set up to fill out online forms using just one key.

API Testing
===========
Postman:
--------
The preferred tool for testing API calls, especially RESTful APIs, is the Postman  Extension. It saves a ton of time by allowing you to quickly set up and swap environment variables. In order to facilitate team cooperation, you may bundle test API calls into collections that sync to the cloud. Additionally, Postman has a short learning curve, so you'll be testing APIs in no time.

Security and Penetration Testing
================================
Burp suite:
----------
A set of tools called Burp or Burp Suite is used to test the security of web applications. It is created by the business Portswigger, whose founder Dafydd Stuttard also goes by that name. BurpSuite is designed to be an all-in-one toolkit, and BApps are add-ons that can be installed to expand its functionality.

Owasp zap:
----------
Web application security scanner OWASP ZAP (short for Zed Attack Proxy) is free and open-source. It is designed to be utilized by expert penetration testers as well as individuals who are new to application security. It has been granted Flagship status and is one of the most active Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) projects.

Accessibility Testing
=====================
WAVE:
-----
WAVE is a fantastic tool for evaluating the online accessibility of any website in comparison to the WCAG standards. The WAVE Evaluation tool adds WAVE capabilities to your browser and offers visual feedback regarding the accessibility of a web page by inserting symbols and indicators into the web page. This tool is beneficial for accessibility testing.

Accessibility Developer Tools:
------------------------------
Developer Accessibility Tools The accessibility audit and sidebar pane that the chrome extension provides to the components tab of the chrome developer tools genuinely belong in the core set of tools that come with Chrome. When you perform the accessibility audit, it will identify the WCAG 2.0 guidelines that the page violates, including any missing ARIA properties.

Increase productivity
======================
Todoist:
--------
If you don't already schedule your day with to-do lists, organize your test day right away using a to-do list or task manager. A to-do list may assist in breaking down enormous work into more minor, manageable chores, and when you do these tiny activities, you'll feel accomplished. Todoist enhances valuable features in a simple and practical location—your browser. You can also bookmark any webpage to read it later.

Google Keep:
------------
With the push of a button, Google Keep, a fantastic note-taking software, enables you to rapidly write notes in Chrome. When testing and gathering proof of flaws, you may store a picture, link, or text on a page and add comments to the saved material for subsequent reference. Additionally, you may categorize your notes and make to-do lists to further organize them.

MindMup:
---------
You may freely construct mind maps with MindMup.  Mind maps are an excellent approach to capturing your understanding of application flow, recording alternative situations, and identifying dependencies among system components. You have the opportunity to accomplish that with MindMup without leaving your browser. Its clear and straightforward interface allows you to make mind maps and communicate with others in real-time. Dropbox and Google Drive are connected. You can access your mind maps from any location using a desktop browser, tablet, or mobile device because they are stored in the cloud.

iMacros:
---------
Despite your best efforts, you testers do wind yourself doing the same set of activities every day. When testing websites, you may simplify your life using the helpful Chrome plugin iMacros, which lets you record and replay your activities on any website. While there are frameworks like Selenium WebDriver and others for complex automation requirements, you may utilize iMacros to automate your routine everyday tasks like smoke testing builds, which often entail doing the same click-actions every day. To save time for other urgent things, you might also utilize iMacros to access the same collection of web pages or websites. Or just do it using Session Manager.
